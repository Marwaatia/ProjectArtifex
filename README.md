# ProjectArtifex

Project Artifex is a project built for php developers to help handling faster with mysqli tables.

Just do the following:

##1: Build your OOP the correct way
##2: Name your table attributes the same as your objects attributes.
##3: Cast your objects into arrays.
##4: Use the unset() on your casted object (now your array) if you wanted to remove something.
